I may have gone too far with this one.

I had a dream to make an agentic AI system that does research in fundamental physics:

Find and read recent papers

Determine future research directions

Write a new research paper as LaTeX and render as PDF

And then I made my dream come true!

‚ÄúMuhahahaha‚Ä¶.‚Äù
