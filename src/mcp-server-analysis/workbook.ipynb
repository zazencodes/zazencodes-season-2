It enables MCP clients to interact directly with existing HTTP services without requiring any server-side interface modifications.  \\r\\n<p align=\"center\">\\r\\n  <a href=\"./README.md\"><img alt=\"README in English\" src=\"https://img.shields.io/badge/English-4578DA\"></a>\\r\\n  <a href=\"./README_CN.md\"><img alt=\"简体中文版\" src=\"https://img.shields.io/badge/简体中文-F40002\"></a>\\r\\n  <a href=\"https://deepwiki.com/sxhxliang/mcp-access-point\"><img src=\"https://deepwiki.com/badge.svg\" alt=\"Ask DeepWiki\"></a>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n## Introduction  \\r\\nThis project is built on `Pingora` - an ultra-high performance gateway proxy library capable of supporting massive-scale request proxy services. Pingora has been used to build services that handle core traffic for the Cloudflare platform, consistently serving over 40 million requests per second across the internet for years. It has become the technical cornerstone supporting a significant proportion of traffic on the Cloudflare platform.\\r\\n\\r\\n## HTTP to MCP  \\r\\nThis mode allows clients like `Cursor Desktop` to communicate with remote HTTP servers through `SSE`, even when the servers themselves don\\'t support the SSE protocol.\\r\\n\\r\\n- Example setup includes two services:  \\r\\n  - Service 1 runs locally at `127.0.0.1:8090`  \\r\\n  - Service 2 runs remotely at `api.example.com`  \\r\\n- Through the `MCP Access Point`, both services can be converted to MCP services without any code modifications.  \\r\\n- Clients communicate with `Service 1` and `Service 2` via the MCP protocol. The MCP Access Point automatically distinguishes MCP requests and forwards them to the appropriate backend services.\\r\\n\\r\\n```mermaid\\r\\ngraph LR\\r\\n   A[\"Cursor Desktop\"] <--> |SSE| B[\"MCP Access Point\"]\\r\\n   A2[\"Other Desktop\"] <--> |Streamable Http| B[\"MCP Access Point\"]\\r\\n   B <--> |http 127.0.0.1:8090| C1[\"Existing API Server\"]\\r\\n   B <--> |https//api.example.com| C2[\"Existing API Server\"]\\r\\n  \\r\\n   style A2 fill:#ffe6f9,stroke:#333,color:black,stroke-width:2px\\r\\n   style A fill:#ffe6f9,stroke:#333,color:black,stroke-width:2px\\r\\n   style B fill:#e6e6af,stroke:#333,color:black,stroke-width:2px\\r\\n   style C1 fill:#e6ffe6,stroke:#333,color:black,stroke-width:2px\\r\\n   style C2 fill:#e6ffd6,stroke:#333,color:black,stroke-width:2px\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Transport Type (Specification)\\r\\nCurrently supports `SSE` and `Streamable HTTP` protocols:\\r\\n- ✅ Streamable HTTP (stateless) 2024-03-26\\r\\n  - All services: `ip:port/mcp`\\r\\n  - Single service: `ip:port/api/{service_id}/mcp`\\r\\n  \\r\\n- ✅ SSE 2024-11-05\\r\\n  - All services: `ip:port/sse`\\r\\n  - Single service: `ip:port/api/{service_id}/sse/`\\r\\n\\r\\nuse `IP:PORT/sse` for `SSE` \\r\\nuse `IP:PORT/mcp` for `Streamable HTTP` \\r\\n\\r\\n### Supported MCP clients\\r\\n- ✅ [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector)\\r\\n- ✅ [Cursor Desktop](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol)\\r\\n\\r\\n## Core Features  \\r\\n- **Protocol Conversion**: Seamless conversion between HTTP and MCP protocols  \\r\\n- **Zero-Intrusive Integration**: Full compatibility with existing HTTP services  \\r\\n- **Client Empowerment**: Enables MCP clients to directly call standard HTTP services  \\r\\n- **Lightweight Proxy**: Minimalist architecture with efficient protocol conversion  \\r\\n- **Multi-tenancy**: Independent configuration and endpoints for each tenant\\r\\n\\r\\n## Quick Start  \\r\\n\\r\\n### Installation  \\r\\n```bash\\r\\n# Install from source\\r\\ngit clone https://github.com/sxhxliang/mcp-access-point.git\\r\\ncd mcp-access-point\\r\\ncargo run -- -c config.yaml\\r\\n\\r\\n# Use inspector for debugging (start service first)\\r\\nnpx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node build/index.js\\r\\n# Access http://127.0.0.1:6274/\\r\\n# Select \"see\" and enter 0.0.0.0:8080/sse, then click connect\\r\\n# or select \"Streamable HTTP\" and enter 0.0.0.0:8080/mcp\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Multi-tenancy Support\\r\\nThe MCP Access Gateway supports multi-tenancy, where each tenant can configure multiple MCP services accessible via:\\r\\n- `/api/{mcp-service-id}/sse` (for SSE)\\r\\n- `/api/{mcp-service-id}/mcp` (for Streamable HTTP)\\r\\n\\r\\nExample configuration:\\r\\n```yaml\\r\\n# config.yaml example (supports multiple services)\\r\\n\\r\\nmcps:\\r\\n  - id: service-1 # Access via /api/service-1/sse or /api/service-1/mcp\\r\\n    ... # Service configuration\\r\\n  - id: service-2 # Access via /api/service-2/sse or /api/service-2/mcp\\r\\n    ... # Service configuration\\r\\n  - id: service-3 # Access via /api/service-3/sse or /api/service-3/mcp\\r\\n    ... # Service configuration\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nTo access all services simultaneously, use:\\r\\n- `0.0.0.0:8080/mcp` (Streamable HTTP)\\r\\n- `0.0.0.0:8080/sse` (SSE)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Configuration Details\\r\\n1. **`-c config.yaml`**\\r\\n   - `-c` (or `--config`) specifies the configuration file path (`config.yaml`).\\r\\n   - This file defines the APIs that the MCP Access Point will proxy and convert.\\r\\n\\r\\n### config.yaml Example\\r\\nThe configuration file supports multi-tenancy, allowing independent configuration of upstream services and routing rules for each MCP service.

After verifying, it can take 15–20 minutes for image API access to activate.\\n- File paths must be absolute.\\n  - **Unix/macOS/Linux**: Starting with `/` (e.g., `/path/to/image.png`)\\n  - **Windows**: Drive letter followed by `:` (e.g., `C:/path/to/image.png` or `C:\\\\path\\\\to\\\\image.png`)\\n- For file output, ensure the directory is writable.\\n- If you see errors about file types, check your image file extensions and formats.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## ⚠️ Limitations & Large File Handling\\n\\n- **1MB Payload Limit:** MCP clients (including Claude Desktop) have a hard 1MB limit for tool responses. Large images (especially high-res or multiple images) can easily exceed this limit if returned as base64.\\n- **Auto-Switch to File Output:** If the total image size exceeds 1MB, the tool will automatically save images to disk and return the file path(s) instead of base64. This ensures compatibility and prevents errors like `result exceeds maximum length of 1048576`.\\n- **Default File Location:** If you do not specify a `file_output` path, images will be saved to `/tmp` (or the directory set by the `MCP_HF_WORK_DIR` environment variable) with a unique filename.\\n- **Environment Variable:**\\n  - `MCP_HF_WORK_DIR`: Set this to control where large images and file outputs are saved. Example: `export MCP_HF_WORK_DIR=/your/desired/dir`\\n- **Best Practice:** For large or production images, always use file output and ensure your client is configured to handle file paths.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 📚 References\\n\\n- [OpenAI Images API Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/images)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 🙏 Credits\\n\\n- Built with [@modelcontextprotocol/sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@modelcontextprotocol/sdk)\\n- Uses [openai](https://www.npmjs.com/package/openai) Node.js SDK \\n- Built by [SureScale.ai](https://surescale.ai)\\n- Contributions from [Axle Research and Technology](https://axleinfo.com/)',\n",

       "  'readme_text': '# Video Editor MCP server\\n\\n[![Video Jungle MCP Server](./assets/create-edit.png)](https://www.video-jungle.com)\\n\\nSee a demo here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG6TMLD8GmA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG6TMLD8GmA)\\n\\nUpload, edit, search, and generate videos from everyone\\'s favorite LLM and [Video Jungle](https://www.video-jungle.com/).\\n\\nYou\\'ll need to sign up for an account at [Video Jungle](https://app.video-jungle.com/register) in order to use this tool, and add your API key.\\n\\n[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/video-editor-mcp.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/video-editor-mcp)\\n\\n## Components\\n\\n### Resources\\n\\nThe server implements an interface to upload, generate, and edit videos with:\\n- Custom vj:// URI scheme for accessing individual videos and projects\\n- Each project resource has a name, description\\n- Search results are returned with metadata about what is in the video, and when, allowing for edit generation directly\\n\\n### Prompts\\n\\nComing soon.\\n\\n### Tools\\n\\nThe server implements a few tools:\\n- add-video\\n  - Add a Video File for analysis from a URL. Returns an vj:// URI to reference the Video file\\n- create-videojungle-project\\n  - Creates a Video Jungle project to contain generative scripts, analyzed videos, and images for video edit generation\\n- edit-locally\\n  - Creates an OpenTimelineIO project and downloads it to your machine to open in a Davinci Resolve Studio instance (Resolve Studio _must_ already be running before calling this tool.) \\n- generate-edit-from-videos\\n  - Generates a rendered video edit from a set of video files\\n- generate-edit-from-single-video\\n  - Generate an edit from a single input video file\\n- get-project-assets\\n  - Get assets within a project for video edit generation.\\n- search-videos\\n  - Returns video matches based upon embeddings and keywords\\n- update-video-edit\\n  - Live update a video edit\\'s information. If Video Jungle is open, edit will be updated in real time.\\n\\n### Using Tools in Practice\\n\\nIn order to use the tools, you\\'ll need to sign up for Video Jungle and add your API key.\\n\\n**add-video**\\n\\nHere\\'s an example prompt to invoke the `add-video` tool:\\n\\n```\\ncan you download the video at https://www.youtube.com/shorts/RumgYaH5XYw and name it fly traps?\\n```\\n\\nThis will download a video from a URL, add it to your library, and analyze it for retrieval later. Analysis is multi-modal, so both audio and visual components can be queried against.\\n\\n**search-videos**\\n\\nOnce you\\'ve got a video downloaded and analyzed, you can then do queries on it using the `search-videos` tool:\\n\\n```\\ncan you search my videos for fly traps?\\n```\\n\\nSearch results contain relevant metadata for generating a video edit according to details discovered in the initial analysis.\\n\\n**search-local-videos**\\n\\nYou must set the environment variable `LOAD_PHOTOS_DB=1` in order to use this tool, as it will make Claude prompt to access your files on your local machine.\\n\\nOnce that\\'s done, you can search through your Photos app for videos that exist on your phone, using Apple\\'s tags.\\n\\nIn my case, when I search for \"Skateboard\", I get 1903 video files.\\n\\n```\\ncan you search my local video files for Skateboard?\\n```\\n\\n**generate-edit-from-videos**\\n\\nFinally, you can use these search results to generate an edit:\\n\\n```\\ncan you create an edit of all the times the video says \"fly trap\"?\\n```\\n\\n(Currently), the video edits tool relies on the context within the current chat. \\n\\n**generate-edit-from-single-video**\\n\\nFinally, you can cut down an edit from a single, existing video:\\n\\n```\\ncan you create an edit of all the times this video says the word \"fly trap\"?\\n```\\n\\n## Configuration\\n\\nYou must login to [Video Jungle settings](https://app.video-jungle.com/profile/settings), and get your [API key](https://app.video-jungle.com/profile/settings). Then, use this to start Video Jungle MCP:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ uv run video-editor-mcp YOURAPIKEY\\n```\\n\\nTo allow this MCP server to search your Photos app on MacOS:\\n\\n```\\n$ LOAD_PHOTOS_DB=1 uv run video-editor-mcp YOURAPIKEY\\n```\\n## Quickstart\\n\\n### Install\\n\\n#### Installing via Smithery\\n\\nTo install Video Editor for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/video-editor-mcp):\\n\\n```bash\\nnpx -y @smithery/cli install video-editor-mcp --client claude\\n```\\n\\n#### Claude Desktop\\n\\nYou\\'ll need to adjust your `claude_desktop_config.json` manually:\\n\\nOn MacOS: `~/Library/Application\\\\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\\nOn Windows: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\\n\\n<details>\\n<details>\\n  <summary>Published Server Configuration</summary>\\n  \\n ```json\\n  \"mcpServers\": {\\n    \"video-editor-mcp\": {\\n      \"command\": \"uvx\",\\n      \"args\": [\\n        \"video-editor-mcp\",\\n        \"YOURAPIKEY\"\\n      ]\\n    }\\n  }\\n  ```\\n</details>\\n  <summary>Development/Unpublished Servers Configuration</summary>\\n  \\n ```json\\n  \"mcpServers\": {\\n    \"video-editor-mcp\": {\\n      \"command\": \"uv\",\\n      \"args\": [\\n        \"--directory\",\\n        \"/Users/YOURDIRECTORY/video-editor-mcp\",\\n        \"run\",\\n        \"video-editor-mcp\",\\n        \"YOURAPIKEY\"\\n      ]\\n    }\\n  }\\n  ```\\n\\n  With local Photos app access enabled (search your Photos app):\\n\\n  ```json\\n    \"video-jungle-mcp\": {\\n      \"command\": \"uv\",\\n      \"args\": [\\n        \"--directory\",\\n        \"/Users/<PATH_TO>/video-jungle-mcp\",\\n        \"run\",\\n        \"video-editor-mcp\",\\n        \"<YOURAPIKEY>\"\\n      ],\\n     \"env\": {\\n\\t      \"LOAD_PHOTOS_DB\": \"1\"\\n      }\\n    },\\n  ```\\n\\n</details>\\n\\nBe sure to replace the directories with the directories you\\'ve placed the repository in on **your** computer.\\n\\n## Development\\n\\n### Building and Publishing\\n\\nTo prepare the package for distribution:\\n\\n1. Sync dependencies and update lockfile:\\n```bash\\nuv sync\\n```\\n\\n2. Build package distributions:\\n```bash\\nuv build\\n```\\n\\nThis will create source and wheel distributions in the `dist/` directory.\\n\\n3. Publish to PyPI:\\n```bash\\nuv publish\\n```\\n\\nNote: You\\'ll need to set PyPI credentials via environment variables or command flags:\\n- Token: `--token` or `UV_PUBLISH_TOKEN`\\n- Or username/password: `--username`/`UV_PUBLISH_USERNAME` and `--password`/`UV_PUBLISH_PASSWORD`\\n\\n### Debugging\\n\\nSince MCP servers run over stdio, debugging can be challenging. For the best debugging\\nexperience, we strongly recommend using the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector).\\n\\n\\nYou can launch the MCP Inspector via [`npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) with this command:\\n\\n(Be sure to replace `YOURDIRECTORY` and `YOURAPIKEY` with the directory this repo is in, and your Video Jungle API key, found in the settings page.)\\n\\n```bash\\nnpx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv run --directory /Users/YOURDIRECTORY/video-editor-mcp video-editor-mcp YOURAPIKEY\\n```\\n\\n\\nUpon launching, the Inspector will display a URL that you can access in your browser to begin debugging.\\n\\nAdditionally, I\\'ve added logging to `app.log` in the project directory. You can add logging to diagnose API calls via a:\\n\\n```\\nlogging.info(\"this is a test log\")\\n```\\n\\nA reasonable way to follow along as you\\'re workin on the project is to open a terminal session and do a:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ tail -n 90 -f app.log\\n```\\n',\n",

Use the `NPX` method from that section.\\n\\n## Table of Contents\\n\\n- [Acknowledgements](#acknowledgements)\\n- [Available Tools](#available-tools)\\n- [Caveats](#caveats)\\n- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)\\n- [Setup](#setup)\\n- [Running the Server](#running-the-server-locally)\\n  - [Option 1: Local Development](#option-1-local-development)\\n  - [Option 2: Docker](#option-2-docker)\\n- [Inspection](#inspection)\\n- [MCP Clients](#mcp-clients)\\n  - [Claude Desktop Configuration](#claude-desktop-configuration)\\n    - [NPX](#npx)\\n    - [Local Node](#local-node)\\n    - [Docker](#docker)\\n- [TODO](#todo)\\n- [License](#license)\\n\\n## Acknowledgements\\n\\nThis MCP server is built using [FastMCP](https://github.com/punkpeye/fastmcp), a typescript framework for building MCP servers. For more information about MCP and how to use MCP servers, please refer to the [FastMCP documentation](https://github.com/punkpeye/fastmcp/blob/main/README.md) and the [official MCP documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io).\\n\\n## Available Tools\\n\\nCheck out the list of available tools: [TOOLS.md](TOOLS.md)\\n\\n## Caveats\\n\\n- The [Discogs API documentation](https://www.discogs.com/developers) is not perfect and some endpoints may not be fully documented or may have inconsistencies.\\n- Due to the vast number of API endpoints and response types, it\\'s not feasible to verify type safety for every possible response. Please report any type-related issues you encounter.\\n- This MCP server allows for editing data in your Discogs collection. Please use with caution and verify your actions before executing them.\\n- The Discogs API `per_page` default is `50`, which can be too much data for some clients to process effectively, so within this project a `discogs.config.defaultPerPage` value has been set to `5`. You can request more data in your prompts, but be aware that some clients may struggle with larger responses.\\n\\n## Prerequisites\\n\\n- Node.js (tested with Node.js `20.x.x`, but `18.x.x` should work as well)\\n  - Check your Node.js version with: `node --version`\\n- Docker (optional, for running a local docker image without having to deal with Node or dependencies)\\n\\n## Setup\\n\\n1. Clone the repository\\n2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory based on `.env.example`\\n3. Set the following required environment variables in your `.env`:\\n   - `DISCOGS_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`: Your Discogs personal access token\\n\\nTo get your Discogs personal access token, go to your [Discogs Settings > Developers](https://www.discogs.com/settings/developers) page and find your token or generate a new one. **_DO NOT SHARE YOUR TOKEN_**. OAuth support will be added in a future release.\\n\\nThe other environment variables in `.env.example` are optional and have sensible defaults, so you don\\'t need to set them unless you have specific requirements.\\n\\n## Running the Server Locally\\n\\n### Option 1: Local Development\\n\\n1. Install dependencies:\\n   ```bash\\n   pnpm install\\n   ```\\n\\n2. Available commands:\\n   - `pnpm run dev`: Start the development server with hot reloading\\n   - `pnpm run dev:stream`: Start the development server with hot reloading in HTTP streaming mode\\n   - `pnpm run build`: Build the production version\\n   - `pnpm run start`: Run the production build\\n   - `pnpm run inspect`: Run the MCP Inspector (see [Inspection](#inspection) section)\\n   - `pnpm run format`: Check code formatting (prettier)\\n   - `pnpm run lint`: Run linter (eslint)\\n   - `pnpm run test`: Run vitest\\n   - `pnpm run test:coverage`: Run vitest v8 coverage\\n   - `pnpm run version:check`: Checks that the package.json version and src/version.ts match\\n\\n### Option 2: Docker\\n\\n1. Build the Docker image:\\n   ```bash\\n   docker build -t discogs-mcp-server:latest .\\n   ```\\n\\n2. Run the container:\\n   ```bash\\n   docker run --env-file .env discogs-mcp-server:latest\\n   ```\\n\\n   For HTTP Streaming transport mode:\\n   ```bash\\n   # The port should match what is in your .env file\\n   docker run --env-file .env -p 3001:3001 discogs-mcp-server:latest stream\\n   ```\\n\\n## Inspection\\n\\nRun the MCP Inspector to test your local MCP server:\\n\\n```bash\\npnpm run inspect\\n```\\n\\nThis will start the MCP Inspector at `http://127.0.0.1:6274`. Visit this URL in your browser to interact with your local MCP server.\\n\\nFor more information about the MCP Inspector, visit [the official documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector).\\n\\n## MCP Clients\\n\\nCurrently, this MCP server has only been tested with Claude Desktop. More client examples will be added in the future.\\n\\n### Claude Desktop Configuration\\n\\nFind your `claude_desktop_config.json` at `Claude > Settings > Developer > Edit Config` and depending on which option you\\'d like, add **JUST ONE** of the following:\\n\\n#### NPX\\n\\nRunning it straight from the npm registry.\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"mcpServers\": {\\n    \"discogs\": {\\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\\n      \"args\": [\\n        \"-y\",\\n        \"discogs-mcp-server\"\\n      ],\\n      \"env\": {\\n        \"DISCOGS_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\": \"<YOUR_TOKEN>\"\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### Local Node\\n\\nDependencies should have been installed before you use this method (`pnpm install`).\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"mcpServers\": {\\n    \"discogs\": {\\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\\n      \"args\": [\\n        \"tsx\",\\n        \"/PATH/TO/YOUR/PROJECT/FOLDER/src/index.ts\"\\n      ],\\n      \"env\": {\\n        \"DISCOGS_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\": \"<YOUR_TOKEN>\"\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### Docker\\n\\nThe docker image should have been built before using this method.\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"mcpServers\": {\\n    \"discogs\": {\\n      \"command\": \"docker\",\\n      \"args\": [\\n        \"run\",\\n        \"--rm\",\\n        \"-i\",\\n        \"--env-file\",\\n        \"/PATH/TO/YOUR/PROJECT/FOLDER/.env\",\\n        \"discogs-mcp-server:latest\"\\n      ]\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAny changes to local code will require Claude to be restarted to take effect. Also, Claude requires human-in-the-loop interaction to allow an MCP tool to be run, so everytime a new tool is accessed Claude will ask for permission. You usually only have to do this once per tool per chat. _If using the free version, long chats may result in more frequent errors trying to run tools as Claude limits the amount of context within a single chat._\\n\\n## TODO\\n\\n- OAuth support\\n- Missing tools:\\n  - Inventory uploading\\n\\n## License\\n\\nThis MCP server is licensed under the MIT License.

It enables MCP clients to interact directly with existing HTTP services without requiring any server-side interface modifications.  \\r\\n<p align=\"center\">\\r\\n  <a href=\"./README.md\"><img alt=\"README in English\" src=\"https://img.shields.io/badge/English-4578DA\"></a>\\r\\n  <a href=\"./README_CN.md\"><img alt=\"简体中文版\" src=\"https://img.shields.io/badge/简体中文-F40002\"></a>\\r\\n  <a href=\"https://deepwiki.com/sxhxliang/mcp-access-point\"><img src=\"https://deepwiki.com/badge.svg\" alt=\"Ask DeepWiki\"></a>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n## Introduction  \\r\\nThis project is built on `Pingora` - an ultra-high performance gateway proxy library capable of supporting massive-scale request proxy services. Pingora has been used to build services that handle core traffic for the Cloudflare platform, consistently serving over 40 million requests per second across the internet for years. It has become the technical cornerstone supporting a significant proportion of traffic on the Cloudflare platform.\\r\\n\\r\\n## HTTP to MCP  \\r\\nThis mode allows clients like `Cursor Desktop` to communicate with remote HTTP servers through `SSE`, even when the servers themselves don\\'t support the SSE protocol.\\r\\n\\r\\n- Example setup includes two services:  \\r\\n  - Service 1 runs locally at `127.0.0.1:8090`  \\r\\n  - Service 2 runs remotely at `api.example.com`  \\r\\n- Through the `MCP Access Point`, both services can be converted to MCP services without any code modifications.  \\r\\n- Clients communicate with `Service 1` and `Service 2` via the MCP protocol. The MCP Access Point automatically distinguishes MCP requests and forwards them to the appropriate backend services.\\r\\n\\r\\n```mermaid\\r\\ngraph LR\\r\\n   A[\"Cursor Desktop\"] <--> |SSE| B[\"MCP Access Point\"]\\r\\n   A2[\"Other Desktop\"] <--> |Streamable Http| B[\"MCP Access Point\"]\\r\\n   B <--> |http 127.0.0.1:8090| C1[\"Existing API Server\"]\\r\\n   B <--> |https//api.example.com| C2[\"Existing API Server\"]\\r\\n  \\r\\n   style A2 fill:#ffe6f9,stroke:#333,color:black,stroke-width:2px\\r\\n   style A fill:#ffe6f9,stroke:#333,color:black,stroke-width:2px\\r\\n   style B fill:#e6e6af,stroke:#333,color:black,stroke-width:2px\\r\\n   style C1 fill:#e6ffe6,stroke:#333,color:black,stroke-width:2px\\r\\n   style C2 fill:#e6ffd6,stroke:#333,color:black,stroke-width:2px\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Transport Type (Specification)\\r\\nCurrently supports `SSE` and `Streamable HTTP` protocols:\\r\\n- ✅ Streamable HTTP (stateless) 2024-03-26\\r\\n  - All services: `ip:port/mcp`\\r\\n  - Single service: `ip:port/api/{service_id}/mcp`\\r\\n  \\r\\n- ✅ SSE 2024-11-05\\r\\n  - All services: `ip:port/sse`\\r\\n  - Single service: `ip:port/api/{service_id}/sse/`\\r\\n\\r\\nuse `IP:PORT/sse` for `SSE` \\r\\nuse `IP:PORT/mcp` for `Streamable HTTP` \\r\\n\\r\\n### Supported MCP clients\\r\\n- ✅ [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector)\\r\\n- ✅ [Cursor Desktop](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol)\\r\\n\\r\\n## Core Features  \\r\\n- **Protocol Conversion**: Seamless conversion between HTTP and MCP protocols  \\r\\n- **Zero-Intrusive Integration**: Full compatibility with existing HTTP services  \\r\\n- **Client Empowerment**: Enables MCP clients to directly call standard HTTP services  \\r\\n- **Lightweight Proxy**: Minimalist architecture with efficient protocol conversion  \\r\\n- **Multi-tenancy**: Independent configuration and endpoints for each tenant\\r\\n\\r\\n## Quick Start  \\r\\n\\r\\n### Installation  \\r\\n```bash\\r\\n# Install from source\\r\\ngit clone https://github.com/sxhxliang/mcp-access-point.git\\r\\ncd mcp-access-point\\r\\ncargo run -- -c config.yaml\\r\\n\\r\\n# Use inspector for debugging (start service first)\\r\\nnpx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node build/index.js\\r\\n# Access http://127.0.0.1:6274/\\r\\n# Select \"see\" and enter 0.0.0.0:8080/sse, then click connect\\r\\n# or select \"Streamable HTTP\" and enter 0.0.0.0:8080/mcp\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Multi-tenancy Support\\r\\nThe MCP Access Gateway supports multi-tenancy, where each tenant can configure multiple MCP services accessible via:\\r\\n- `/api/{mcp-service-id}/sse` (for SSE)\\r\\n- `/api/{mcp-service-id}/mcp` (for Streamable HTTP)\\r\\n\\r\\nExample configuration:\\r\\n```yaml\\r\\n# config.yaml example (supports multiple services)\\r\\n\\r\\nmcps:\\r\\n  - id: service-1 # Access via /api/service-1/sse or /api/service-1/mcp\\r\\n    ... # Service configuration\\r\\n  - id: service-2 # Access via /api/service-2/sse or /api/service-2/mcp\\r\\n    ... # Service configuration\\r\\n  - id: service-3 # Access via /api/service-3/sse or /api/service-3/mcp\\r\\n    ... # Service configuration\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nTo access all services simultaneously, use:\\r\\n- `0.0.0.0:8080/mcp` (Streamable HTTP)\\r\\n- `0.0.0.0:8080/sse` (SSE)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Configuration Details\\r\\n1. **`-c config.yaml`**\\r\\n   - `-c` (or `--config`) specifies the configuration file path (`config.yaml`).\\r\\n   - This file defines the APIs that the MCP Access Point will proxy and convert.\\r\\n\\r\\n### config.yaml Example\\r\\nThe configuration file supports multi-tenancy, allowing independent configuration of upstream services and routing rules for each MCP service.

After verifying, it can take 15–20 minutes for image API access to activate.\\n- File paths must be absolute.\\n  - **Unix/macOS/Linux**: Starting with `/` (e.g., `/path/to/image.png`)\\n  - **Windows**: Drive letter followed by `:` (e.g., `C:/path/to/image.png` or `C:\\\\path\\\\to\\\\image.png`)\\n- For file output, ensure the directory is writable.\\n- If you see errors about file types, check your image file extensions and formats.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## ⚠️ Limitations & Large File Handling\\n\\n- **1MB Payload Limit:** MCP clients (including Claude Desktop) have a hard 1MB limit for tool responses. Large images (especially high-res or multiple images) can easily exceed this limit if returned as base64.\\n- **Auto-Switch to File Output:** If the total image size exceeds 1MB, the tool will automatically save images to disk and return the file path(s) instead of base64. This ensures compatibility and prevents errors like `result exceeds maximum length of 1048576`.\\n- **Default File Location:** If you do not specify a `file_output` path, images will be saved to `/tmp` (or the directory set by the `MCP_HF_WORK_DIR` environment variable) with a unique filename.\\n- **Environment Variable:**\\n  - `MCP_HF_WORK_DIR`: Set this to control where large images and file outputs are saved. Example: `export MCP_HF_WORK_DIR=/your/desired/dir`\\n- **Best Practice:** For large or production images, always use file output and ensure your client is configured to handle file paths.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 📚 References\\n\\n- [OpenAI Images API Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/images)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 🙏 Credits\\n\\n- Built with [@modelcontextprotocol/sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@modelcontextprotocol/sdk)\\n- Uses [openai](https://www.npmjs.com/package/openai) Node.js SDK \\n- Built by [SureScale.ai](https://surescale.ai)\\n- Contributions from [Axle Research and Technology](https://axleinfo.com/)'},\n",

Returns an vj:// URI to reference the Video file\\n- create-videojungle-project\\n  - Creates a Video Jungle project to contain generative scripts, analyzed videos, and images for video edit generation\\n- edit-locally\\n  - Creates an OpenTimelineIO project and downloads it to your machine to open in a Davinci Resolve Studio instance (Resolve Studio _must_ already be running before calling this tool.) \\n- generate-edit-from-videos\\n  - Generates a rendered video edit from a set of video files\\n- generate-edit-from-single-video\\n  - Generate an edit from a single input video file\\n- get-project-assets\\n  - Get assets within a project for video edit generation.\\n- search-videos\\n  - Returns video matches based upon embeddings and keywords\\n- update-video-edit\\n  - Live update a video edit\\'s information. If Video Jungle is open, edit will be updated in real time.\\n\\n### Using Tools in Practice\\n\\nIn order to use the tools, you\\'ll need to sign up for Video Jungle and add your API key.\\n\\n**add-video**\\n\\nHere\\'s an example prompt to invoke the `add-video` tool:\\n\\n```\\ncan you download the video at https://www.youtube.com/shorts/RumgYaH5XYw and name it fly traps?\\n```\\n\\nThis will download a video from a URL, add it to your library, and analyze it for retrieval later. Analysis is multi-modal, so both audio and visual components can be queried against.\\n\\n**search-videos**\\n\\nOnce you\\'ve got a video downloaded and analyzed, you can then do queries on it using the `search-videos` tool:\\n\\n```\\ncan you search my videos for fly traps?\\n```\\n\\nSearch results contain relevant metadata for generating a video edit according to details discovered in the initial analysis.\\n\\n**search-local-videos**\\n\\nYou must set the environment variable `LOAD_PHOTOS_DB=1` in order to use this tool, as it will make Claude prompt to access your files on your local machine.\\n\\nOnce that\\'s done, you can search through your Photos app for videos that exist on your phone, using Apple\\'s tags.\\n\\nIn my case, when I search for \"Skateboard\", I get 1903 video files.\\n\\n```\\ncan you search my local video files for Skateboard?\\n```\\n\\n**generate-edit-from-videos**\\n\\nFinally, you can use these search results to generate an edit:\\n\\n```\\ncan you create an edit of all the times the video says \"fly trap\"?\\n```\\n\\n(Currently), the video edits tool relies on the context within the current chat. \\n\\n**generate-edit-from-single-video**\\n\\nFinally, you can cut down an edit from a single, existing video:\\n\\n```\\ncan you create an edit of all the times this video says the word \"fly trap\"?\\n```\\n\\n## Configuration\\n\\nYou must login to [Video Jungle settings](https://app.video-jungle.com/profile/settings), and get your [API key](https://app.video-jungle.com/profile/settings). Then, use this to start Video Jungle MCP:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ uv run video-editor-mcp YOURAPIKEY\\n```\\n\\nTo allow this MCP server to search your Photos app on MacOS:\\n\\n```\\n$ LOAD_PHOTOS_DB=1 uv run video-editor-mcp YOURAPIKEY\\n```\\n## Quickstart\\n\\n### Install\\n\\n#### Installing via Smithery\\n\\nTo install Video Editor for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/video-editor-mcp):\\n\\n```bash\\nnpx -y @smithery/cli install video-editor-mcp --client claude\\n```\\n\\n#### Claude Desktop\\n\\nYou\\'ll need to adjust your `claude_desktop_config.json` manually:\\n\\nOn MacOS: `~/Library/Application\\\\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\\nOn Windows: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\\n\\n<details>\\n<details>\\n  <summary>Published Server Configuration</summary>\\n  \\n ```json\\n  \"mcpServers\": {\\n    \"video-editor-mcp\": {\\n      \"command\": \"uvx\",\\n      \"args\": [\\n        \"video-editor-mcp\",\\n        \"YOURAPIKEY\"\\n      ]\\n    }\\n  }\\n  ```\\n</details>\\n  <summary>Development/Unpublished Servers Configuration</summary>\\n  \\n ```json\\n  \"mcpServers\": {\\n    \"video-editor-mcp\": {\\n      \"command\": \"uv\",\\n      \"args\": [\\n        \"--directory\",\\n        \"/Users/YOURDIRECTORY/video-editor-mcp\",\\n        \"run\",\\n        \"video-editor-mcp\",\\n        \"YOURAPIKEY\"\\n      ]\\n    }\\n  }\\n  ```\\n\\n  With local Photos app access enabled (search your Photos app):\\n\\n  ```json\\n    \"video-jungle-mcp\": {\\n      \"command\": \"uv\",\\n      \"args\": [\\n        \"--directory\",\\n        \"/Users/<PATH_TO>/video-jungle-mcp\",\\n        \"run\",\\n        \"video-editor-mcp\",\\n        \"<YOURAPIKEY>\"\\n      ],\\n     \"env\": {\\n\\t      \"LOAD_PHOTOS_DB\": \"1\"\\n      }\\n    },\\n  ```\\n\\n</details>\\n\\nBe sure to replace the directories with the directories you\\'ve placed the repository in on **your** computer.\\n\\n## Development\\n\\n### Building and Publishing\\n\\nTo prepare the package for distribution:\\n\\n1. Sync dependencies and update lockfile:\\n```bash\\nuv sync\\n```\\n\\n2. Build package distributions:\\n```bash\\nuv build\\n```\\n\\nThis will create source and wheel distributions in the `dist/` directory.\\n\\n3. Publish to PyPI:\\n```bash\\nuv publish\\n```\\n\\nNote: You\\'ll need to set PyPI credentials via environment variables or command flags:\\n- Token: `--token` or `UV_PUBLISH_TOKEN`\\n- Or username/password: `--username`/`UV_PUBLISH_USERNAME` and `--password`/`UV_PUBLISH_PASSWORD`\\n\\n### Debugging\\n\\nSince MCP servers run over stdio, debugging can be challenging. For the best debugging\\nexperience, we strongly recommend using the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector).\\n\\n\\nYou can launch the MCP Inspector via [`npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) with this command:\\n\\n(Be sure to replace `YOURDIRECTORY` and `YOURAPIKEY` with the directory this repo is in, and your Video Jungle API key, found in the settings page.)\\n\\n```bash\\nnpx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv run --directory /Users/YOURDIRECTORY/video-editor-mcp video-editor-mcp YOURAPIKEY\\n```\\n\\n\\nUpon launching, the Inspector will display a URL that you can access in your browser to begin debugging.\\n\\nAdditionally, I\\'ve added logging to `app.log` in the project directory. You can add logging to diagnose API calls via a:\\n\\n```\\nlogging.info(\"this is a test log\")\\n```\\n\\nA reasonable way to follow along as you\\'re workin on the project is to open a terminal session and do a:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ tail -n 90 -f app.log\\n```\\n'},\n",

Use the `NPX` method from that section.\\n\\n## Table of Contents\\n\\n- [Acknowledgements](#acknowledgements)\\n- [Available Tools](#available-tools)\\n- [Caveats](#caveats)\\n- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)\\n- [Setup](#setup)\\n- [Running the Server](#running-the-server-locally)\\n  - [Option 1: Local Development](#option-1-local-development)\\n  - [Option 2: Docker](#option-2-docker)\\n- [Inspection](#inspection)\\n- [MCP Clients](#mcp-clients)\\n  - [Claude Desktop Configuration](#claude-desktop-configuration)\\n    - [NPX](#npx)\\n    - [Local Node](#local-node)\\n    - [Docker](#docker)\\n- [TODO](#todo)\\n- [License](#license)\\n\\n## Acknowledgements\\n\\nThis MCP server is built using [FastMCP](https://github.com/punkpeye/fastmcp), a typescript framework for building MCP servers. For more information about MCP and how to use MCP servers, please refer to the [FastMCP documentation](https://github.com/punkpeye/fastmcp/blob/main/README.md) and the [official MCP documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io).\\n\\n## Available Tools\\n\\nCheck out the list of available tools: [TOOLS.md](TOOLS.md)\\n\\n## Caveats\\n\\n- The [Discogs API documentation](https://www.discogs.com/developers) is not perfect and some endpoints may not be fully documented or may have inconsistencies.\\n- Due to the vast number of API endpoints and response types, it\\'s not feasible to verify type safety for every possible response. Please report any type-related issues you encounter.\\n- This MCP server allows for editing data in your Discogs collection. Please use with caution and verify your actions before executing them.\\n- The Discogs API `per_page` default is `50`, which can be too much data for some clients to process effectively, so within this project a `discogs.config.defaultPerPage` value has been set to `5`. You can request more data in your prompts, but be aware that some clients may struggle with larger responses.\\n\\n## Prerequisites\\n\\n- Node.js (tested with Node.js `20.x.x`, but `18.x.x` should work as well)\\n  - Check your Node.js version with: `node --version`\\n- Docker (optional, for running a local docker image without having to deal with Node or dependencies)\\n\\n## Setup\\n\\n1. Clone the repository\\n2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory based on `.env.example`\\n3. Set the following required environment variables in your `.env`:\\n   - `DISCOGS_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`: Your Discogs personal access token\\n\\nTo get your Discogs personal access token, go to your [Discogs Settings > Developers](https://www.discogs.com/settings/developers) page and find your token or generate a new one. **_DO NOT SHARE YOUR TOKEN_**. OAuth support will be added in a future release.\\n\\nThe other environment variables in `.env.example` are optional and have sensible defaults, so you don\\'t need to set them unless you have specific requirements.\\n\\n## Running the Server Locally\\n\\n### Option 1: Local Development\\n\\n1. Install dependencies:\\n   ```bash\\n   pnpm install\\n   ```\\n\\n2. Available commands:\\n   - `pnpm run dev`: Start the development server with hot reloading\\n   - `pnpm run dev:stream`: Start the development server with hot reloading in HTTP streaming mode\\n   - `pnpm run build`: Build the production version\\n   - `pnpm run start`: Run the production build\\n   - `pnpm run inspect`: Run the MCP Inspector (see [Inspection](#inspection) section)\\n   - `pnpm run format`: Check code formatting (prettier)\\n   - `pnpm run lint`: Run linter (eslint)\\n   - `pnpm run test`: Run vitest\\n   - `pnpm run test:coverage`: Run vitest v8 coverage\\n   - `pnpm run version:check`: Checks that the package.json version and src/version.ts match\\n\\n### Option 2: Docker\\n\\n1. Build the Docker image:\\n   ```bash\\n   docker build -t discogs-mcp-server:latest .\\n   ```\\n\\n2. Run the container:\\n   ```bash\\n   docker run --env-file .env discogs-mcp-server:latest\\n   ```\\n\\n   For HTTP Streaming transport mode:\\n   ```bash\\n   # The port should match what is in your .env file\\n   docker run --env-file .env -p 3001:3001 discogs-mcp-server:latest stream\\n   ```\\n\\n## Inspection\\n\\nRun the MCP Inspector to test your local MCP server:\\n\\n```bash\\npnpm run inspect\\n```\\n\\nThis will start the MCP Inspector at `http://127.0.0.1:6274`. Visit this URL in your browser to interact with your local MCP server.\\n\\nFor more information about the MCP Inspector, visit [the official documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector).\\n\\n## MCP Clients\\n\\nCurrently, this MCP server has only been tested with Claude Desktop. More client examples will be added in the future.\\n\\n### Claude Desktop Configuration\\n\\nFind your `claude_desktop_config.json` at `Claude > Settings > Developer > Edit Config` and depending on which option you\\'d like, add **JUST ONE** of the following:\\n\\n#### NPX\\n\\nRunning it straight from the npm registry.\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"mcpServers\": {\\n    \"discogs\": {\\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\\n      \"args\": [\\n        \"-y\",\\n        \"discogs-mcp-server\"\\n      ],\\n      \"env\": {\\n        \"DISCOGS_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\": \"<YOUR_TOKEN>\"\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### Local Node\\n\\nDependencies should have been installed before you use this method (`pnpm install`).\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"mcpServers\": {\\n    \"discogs\": {\\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\\n      \"args\": [\\n        \"tsx\",\\n        \"/PATH/TO/YOUR/PROJECT/FOLDER/src/index.ts\"\\n      ],\\n      \"env\": {\\n        \"DISCOGS_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\": \"<YOUR_TOKEN>\"\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### Docker\\n\\nThe docker image should have been built before using this method.\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"mcpServers\": {\\n    \"discogs\": {\\n      \"command\": \"docker\",\\n      \"args\": [\\n        \"run\",\\n        \"--rm\",\\n        \"-i\",\\n        \"--env-file\",\\n        \"/PATH/TO/YOUR/PROJECT/FOLDER/.env\",\\n        \"discogs-mcp-server:latest\"\\n      ]\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAny changes to local code will require Claude to be restarted to take effect. Also, Claude requires human-in-the-loop interaction to allow an MCP tool to be run, so everytime a new tool is accessed Claude will ask for permission. You usually only have to do this once per tool per chat. _If using the free version, long chats may result in more frequent errors trying to run tools as Claude limits the amount of context within a single chat._\\n\\n## TODO\\n\\n- OAuth support\\n- Missing tools:\\n  - Inventory uploading\\n\\n## License\\n\\nThis MCP server is licensed under the MIT License. This means you are free to use, modify, and distribute the software, subject to the terms and conditions of the MIT License.

Pingora has been used to build services that handle core traffic for the Cloudflare platform, consistently serving over 40 million requests per second across the internet for years. It has become the technical cornerstone supporting a significant proportion of traffic on the Cloudflare platform.\\r\\n\\r\\n## HTTP to MCP  \\r\\nThis mode allows clients like `Cursor Desktop` to communicate with remote HTTP servers through `SSE`, even when the servers themselves don\\'t support the SSE protocol.\\r\\n\\r\\n- Example setup includes two services:  \\r\\n  - Service 1 runs locally at `127.0.0.1:8090`  \\r\\n  - Service 2 runs remotely at `api.example.com`  \\r\\n- Through the `MCP Access Point`, both services can be converted to MCP services without any code modifications.  \\r\\n- Clients communicate with `Service 1` and `Service 2` via the MCP protocol. The MCP Access Point automatically distinguishes MCP requests and forwards them to the appropriate backend services.\\r\\n\\r\\n```mermaid\\r\\ngraph LR\\r\\n   A[\"Cursor Desktop\"] <--> |SSE| B[\"MCP Access Point\"]\\r\\n   A2[\"Other Desktop\"] <--> |Streamable Http| B[\"MCP Access Point\"]\\r\\n   B <--> |http 127.0.0.1:8090| C1[\"Existing API Server\"]\\r\\n   B <--> |https//api.example.com| C2[\"Existing API Server\"]\\r\\n  \\r\\n   style A2 fill:#ffe6f9,stroke:#333,color:black,stroke-width:2px\\r\\n   style A fill:#ffe6f9,stroke:#333,color:black,stroke-width:2px\\r\\n   style B fill:#e6e6af,stroke:#333,color:black,stroke-width:2px\\r\\n   style C1 fill:#e6ffe6,stroke:#333,color:black,stroke-width:2px\\r\\n   style C2 fill:#e6ffd6,stroke:#333,color:black,stroke-width:2px\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Transport Type (Specification)\\r\\nCurrently supports `SSE` and `Streamable HTTP` protocols:\\r\\n- ✅ Streamable HTTP (stateless) 2024-03-26\\r\\n  - All services: `ip:port/mcp`\\r\\n  - Single service: `ip:port/api/{service_id}/mcp`\\r\\n  \\r\\n- ✅ SSE 2024-11-05\\r\\n  - All services: `ip:port/sse`\\r\\n  - Single service: `ip:port/api/{service_id}/sse/`\\r\\n\\r\\nuse `IP:PORT/sse` for `SSE` \\r\\nuse `IP:PORT/mcp` for `Streamable HTTP` \\r\\n\\r\\n### Supported MCP clients\\r\\n- ✅ [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector)\\r\\n- ✅ [Cursor Desktop](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol)\\r\\n\\r\\n## Core Features  \\r\\n- **Protocol Conversion**: Seamless conversion between HTTP and MCP protocols  \\r\\n- **Zero-Intrusive Integration**: Full compatibility with existing HTTP services  \\r\\n- **Client Empowerment**: Enables MCP clients to directly call standard HTTP services  \\r\\n- **Lightweight Proxy**: Minimalist architecture with efficient protocol conversion  \\r\\n- **Multi-tenancy**: Independent configuration and endpoints for each tenant\\r\\n\\r\\n## Quick Start  \\r\\n\\r\\n### Installation  \\r\\n```bash\\r\\n# Install from source\\r\\ngit clone https://github.com/sxhxliang/mcp-access-point.git\\r\\ncd mcp-access-point\\r\\ncargo run -- -c config.yaml\\r\\n\\r\\n# Use inspector for debugging (start service first)\\r\\nnpx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node build/index.js\\r\\n# Access http://127.0.0.1:6274/\\r\\n# Select \"see\" and enter 0.0.0.0:8080/sse, then click connect\\r\\n# or select \"Streamable HTTP\" and enter 0.0.0.0:8080/mcp\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Multi-tenancy Support\\r\\nThe MCP Access Gateway supports multi-tenancy, where each tenant can configure multiple MCP services accessible via:\\r\\n- `/api/{mcp-service-id}/sse` (for SSE)\\r\\n- `/api/{mcp-service-id}/mcp` (for Streamable HTTP)\\r\\n\\r\\nExample configuration:\\r\\n```yaml\\r\\n# config.yaml example (supports multiple services)\\r\\n\\r\\nmcps:\\r\\n  - id: service-1 # Access via /api/service-1/sse or /api/service-1/mcp\\r\\n    ... # Service configuration\\r\\n  - id: service-2 # Access via /api/service-2/sse or /api/service-2/mcp\\r\\n    ... # Service configuration\\r\\n  - id: service-3 # Access via /api/service-3/sse or /api/service-3/mcp\\r\\n    ... # Service configuration\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nTo access all services simultaneously, use:\\r\\n- `0.0.0.0:8080/mcp` (Streamable HTTP)\\r\\n- `0.0.0.0:8080/sse` (SSE)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Configuration Details\\r\\n1. **`-c config.yaml`**\\r\\n   - `-c` (or `--config`) specifies the configuration file path (`config.yaml`).\\r\\n   - This file defines the APIs that the MCP Access Point will proxy and convert.\\r\\n\\r\\n### config.yaml Example\\r\\nThe configuration file supports multi-tenancy, allowing independent configuration of upstream services and routing rules for each MCP service. Key configuration items include:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. **mcps** - MCP service list\\r\\n   - `id`: Unique service identifier used to generate access paths\\r\\n   - `upstream_id`: Associated upstream service ID\\r\\n   - `path`: OpenAPI specification file path (local or remote)\\r\\n   - `routes`: Custom routing configuration (optional)\\r\\n   - `upstream`: Upstream service specific configuration (optional)\\r\\n\\r\\n2. **upstreams** - Upstream service configuration\\r\\n   - `id`: Upstream service ID\\r\\n   - `nodes`: Backend node addresses and weights\\r\\n   - `type`: Load balancing algorithm (roundrobin/random/ip_hash)\\r\\n   - `scheme`: Upstream protocol (http/https)\\r\\n   - `pass_host`: HTTP Host header handling\\r\\n   - `upstream_host`: Override Host header value\\r\\n\\r\\nComplete configuration example:\\r\\n```yaml\\r\\n# config.yaml example (supports multiple services)\\r\\nmcps:\\r\\n  - id: service-1 # Unique identifier, accessible via /api/service-1/sse or /api/service-1/mcp\\r\\n    upstream_id: 1\\r\\n    path: config/openapi_for_demo_patch1.json # Local OpenAPI spec path\\r\\n\\r\\n  - id: service-2 # Unique identifier\\r\\n    upstream_id: 2\\r\\n    path: https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json # Remote OpenAPI spec\\r\\n\\r\\n  - id: service-3 \\r\\n    upstream_id: 3\\r\\n    routes: # Custom routing\\r\\n      - id: 1\\r\\n        operation_id: get_weather\\r\\n        uri: /points/{latitude},{longitude}\\r\\n        method: GET\\r\\n        meta:\\r\\n          name: Get Weather\\r\\n          description: Retrieve weather information by coordinates\\r\\n          inputSchema: # Optional input validation\\r\\n            type: object\\r\\n            required:\\r\\n              - latitude\\r\\n              - longitude\\r\\n            properties:\\r\\n              latitude:\\r\\n                type: number\\r\\n                minimum: -90\\r\\n                maximum: 90\\r\\n              longitude:\\r\\n                type: number\\r\\n                minimum: -180\\r\\n                maximum: 180\\r\\n\\r\\nupstreams: # Required upstream configuration\\r\\n  - id: 1\\r\\n    headers: # Headers to send to upstream service\\r\\n      X-API-Key: \"12345-abcdef\"        # API key\\r\\n      Authorization: \"Bearer token123\" # Bearer token\\r\\n      User-Agent: \"MyApp/1.0\"          # User agent\\r\\n      Accept: \"application/json\"       # Accept header\\r\\n    nodes: # Backend nodes (IP or domain)\\r\\n      \"127.0.0.1:8090\": 1 # Format: address:weight\\r\\n\\r\\n  - id: 2 \\r\\n    nodes:\\r\\n      \"127.0.0.1:8091\": 1\\r\\n\\r\\n  - id: 3 \\r\\n    nodes:\\r\\n      \"api.weather.gov\": 1\\r\\n    type: roundrobin # Load balancing algorithm\\r\\n    scheme: https # Protocol\\r\\n    pass_host: rewrite # Host header handling\\r\\n    upstream_host: api.weather.gov # Override Host\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nTo run the MCP Access Gateway with config file:\\r\\n```bash\\r\\ncargo run -- -c config.yaml\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Running via Docker  \\r\\n\\r\\n### Build Docker Image (Optional)  \\r\\n```bash\\r\\n# Clone repository\\r\\ngit clone https://github.com/sxhxliang/mcp-access-point.git\\r\\ncd mcp-access-point\\r\\n\\r\\n# Build image\\r\\ndocker build -t liangshihua/mcp-access-point:latest .\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Run Docker Container  \\r\\n```bash\\r\\n# Using environment variables (service running on host)\\r\\n# Note: Replace /path/to/your/config.yaml with actual path\\r\\n\\r\\ndocker run -d --name mcp-access-point --rm \\\\\\r\\n  -p 8080:8080 \\\\\\r\\n  -e port=8080 \\\\\\r\\n  -v /path/to/your/config.yaml:/app/config/config.yaml \\\\\\r\\n  liangshihua/mcp-access-point:latest\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Environment Variables  \\r\\n- `port`: MCP Access Point listening port (default: 8080)\\r\\n\\r\\n## Typical Use Cases  \\r\\n\\r\\n- **Progressive Architecture Migration**: Facilitate gradual transition from HTTP to MCP  \\r\\n- **Hybrid Architecture Support**: Reuse existing HTTP infrastructure within MCP ecosystem  \\r\\n- **Protocol Compatibility**: Build hybrid systems supporting both protocols  \\r\\n\\r\\n**Example Scenario**:  \\r\\nWhen MCP-based AI clients need to interface with legacy HTTP microservices, the MCP Access Gateway acts as a middleware layer enabling seamless protocol conversion.',\n",
