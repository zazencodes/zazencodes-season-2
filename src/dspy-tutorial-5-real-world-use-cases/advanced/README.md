Read through all of the example scripts for the DSPy Tutorial one at a time and improve them.

- Create a list of updates to make for each lesson in a new file LESSON_AUDIT.md
    - Audit the content for accuracy with the DSPy docs (use context7 MCP)
    - Think about expansionsa that can help improve the quality of the sectino of the tutorial, where the focus is on demonstrating real-world use cases and teaching how DSPy works

- Iterate through the list of updates and make the corresponding changes. Add some comments to your work where important for context, i.e. to exaplain your decisions, but don't overdo this.
