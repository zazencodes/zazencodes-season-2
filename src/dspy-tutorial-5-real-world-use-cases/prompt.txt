I am going to show you a series of python scripts, one at a time. For each script I need you to create a mermaid diagram that I can use to explain what the script does and how data flows through the application. I will use this to introduce each code snippet in my DSPy tutorial presentation.

Make sure that you create proper mermaid diagrams. Use quotes around all text in labels and do not use newlines, instead use HTML <br> tags for newlines.

Add colors to make it easier to follow.
