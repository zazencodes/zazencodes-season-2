```

Here's a summary of the log file:

Errors (8 total):
1. Database connection failure at localhost:5432
2. Connection timeout
3. Invalid data format in row 145 (integer/string mismatch)
4. JSON parsing failure in users.json
5. Insufficient permissions for output directory
6. Out of memory error during data transformation
7. Unexpected EOF in source file
8. Failed to establish secure connection

Warnings (8 total):
1. Low disk space (85% used)
2. 23 records with missing values
3. High memory usage (>75%)
4. Data loss after JSON repair
5. High network latency (>500ms)
6. High CPU usage (92%)
7. API rate limit near capacity (95%)
8. Using insecure connection

Overall Process Flow:
- Started with database connection issues
- Managed to connect after retry
- Attempted to process data in 5 batches
- Encountered various resource constraints (memory, CPU, disk space)
- Completed with partial success (35% data processed)
- Had to fall back to temporary directory and insecure connection

The process completed but with significant issues, only processing 35% of the data and encountering multiple resource constraints and permission issues.


# Critical TODOs (Error Fixes)

1. Database Connectivity
   - [x] Fix database connection issues at localhost:5432
   - [x] Investigate and resolve connection timeout (30s threshold)
   - [x] Implement proper connection retry mechanism

2. Permission & Security Issues
   - [ ] Fix output directory permissions
   - [ ] Resolve secure connection issues
   - [ ] Implement proper security protocols to avoid insecure fallback
   - [ ] Review and update access rights

3. Data Processing Issues
   - [ ] Fix JSON parsing in users.json
   - [ ] Implement proper data validation for row 145 (integer/string validation)
   - [ ] Investigate and fix unexpected EOF in source file

4. Resource Management
   - [ ] Resolve out of memory errors in data transformation
   - [ ] Optimize memory usage during processing
   - [ ] Implement proper garbage collection strategy

# Important TODOs (Warning Fixes)

1. System Resources
   - [ ] Clean up disk space (currently at 85% usage)
   - [ ] Optimize memory usage (exceeding 75% threshold)
   - [ ] Investigate high CPU usage (92%)
   - [ ] Monitor and optimize network latency (>500ms)

2. Data Quality
   - [ ] Review and fix 23 records with missing values
   - [ ] Implement data validation before processing
   - [ ] Create data quality report

3. Performance & Scaling
   - [ ] Review API rate limits and implement rate limiting
   - [ ] Optimize batch processing (only 35% processed)
   - [ ] Implement proper progress monitoring

# Additional Recommendations

1. Monitoring & Alerting
   - [ ] Set up monitoring for system resources
   - [ ] Implement early warning system for disk space, CPU, and memory
   - [ ] Create automated alerts for critical errors

2. Documentation & Logging
   - [ ] Document all error scenarios and their solutions
   - [ ] Improve error messages with more detailed information
   - [ ] Create recovery procedures for common failures

3. Testing
   - [ ] Create test cases for error scenarios
   - [ ] Implement integration tests for database connectivity
   - [ ] Add performance testing to prevent resource issues
