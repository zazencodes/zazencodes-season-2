## Generate Boilerplate Code for ETL Tasks

### Scenario
You want to create a Python script for a basic ETL pipeline that extracts data from a CSV file, transforms it, and loads it into a database.

### Example Code Snippet
```python
# Example dataset: `data.csv`
# name,age,city
# Alice,30,New York
# Bob,25,Los Angeles
# Charlie,35,Chicago

# Target database: SQLite (for simplicity)
# SQLAlchemy setup (replace `db_url` with your database URL)
db_url = "sqlite:///example.db"

# Empty ETL function
def etl_pipeline():
    pass
```

### Command for AI
Generate an ETL pipeline template in Python using Pandas and SQLAlchemy to read the CSV file, transform the data, and load it into the SQLite database.


## Optimize SQL Queries

### Scenario
You have a SQL query that joins multiple tables and runs slowly. You need to optimize it for better performance.

### Example SQL Query
```sql
-- Current query
SELECT
    u.name AS user_name,
    o.order_id,
    SUM(p.price) AS total_price
FROM
    users u
    JOIN orders o ON u.user_id = o.user_id
    JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
    JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY
    u.name, o.order_id
HAVING
    total_price > 100;
```

### Command for AI
Optimize this query for performance by suggesting indexes or query rewrites.


## Document Complex Code

### Scenario
You have a Python function that calculates user retention but lacks documentation. You want to add docstrings and inline comments for clarity.

### Example Code Snippet
```python
def calculate_retention(user_logins, days):
    active_users = set()
    retained_users = set()

    for day, logins in enumerate(user_logins):
        for user in logins:
            if day < days:
                active_users.add(user)
            if user in active_users:
                retained_users.add(user)

    return len(retained_users) / len(active_users) if active_users else 0
```

### Command for AI
Add detailed docstrings and inline comments explaining this code, including parameter descriptions and return value.

## Convert Data Transformation Logic Between Languages

### Scenario
You have a Pandas-based data transformation and need to port it to PySpark for scalability.

### Example Code Snippet (Before "edit with AI")
```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample dataset
data = {
    "name": ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"],
    "age": [30, 25, 35],
    "city": ["New York", "Los Angeles", "Chicago"],
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Pandas transformation
df["age_category"] = df["age"].apply(lambda x: "Young" if x < 30 else "Old")
df_filtered = df[df["city"] != "Chicago"]
```

### Command for AI
Convert this Pandas transformation to PySpark DataFrame operations.


## Generate Test Cases for Data Pipelines

### Scenario
You want to ensure the robustness of a function that transforms a dataset. You need pytest test cases to validate its behavior.

### Example Code Snippet
```python
# Function to test
def transform_data(df):
    df["age_category"] = df["age"].apply(lambda x: "Young" if x < 30 else "Old")
    df_filtered = df[df["city"] != "Chicago"]
    return df_filtered
```

### Command for AI
Write pytest cases for this function using example inputs and expected outputs.


## Debug Code Snippets

### Scenario
You have a buggy function that processes a dataset, but it throws an error or produces incorrect results.

### Example Code Snippet
```python
# Buggy function
def process_data(data):
    result = []
    for item in data:
        if item["value"] > 10:  # Assuming item always has 'value' key
            result.append(item["name"].upper())  # Name might not exist in all items
    return result

# Example input
data = [
    {"value": 15, "name": "Alice"},
    {"value": 5, "name": "Bob"},
    {"value": 20},  # Missing 'name' key
]
```

### Command for AI
Find and fix any bugs in this function, including handling missing keys and invalid data.

## Generate Schema Migration Scripts

### Scenario
You are adding new columns and constraints to an existing database schema and need a SQL migration script.

### Example Schema Description
```sql
-- Existing table schema
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Changes to apply
-- 1. Add a new column `age` (INT).
-- 2. Add a NOT NULL constraint to `email`.
-- 3. Add a UNIQUE constraint on `email`.
```

### Command for AI
Generate a SQL migration script to apply these changes to the schema.


## Format Large JSON or XML Files

### Scenario
You have a large, unformatted JSON file thatâ€™s difficult to read, and you need it pretty-printed for inspection.

### Example JSON File
```json
{"users":[{"id":1,"name":"Alice","email":"alice@example.com"},{"id":2,"name":"Bob","email":"bob@example.com"}]}
```

### Command for AI
Format this JSON file to be human-readable with proper indentation.


## Summarize Logs or Error Messages

### Scenario
You have a large log file containing various types of messages (INFO, WARNING, ERROR) and need a summary of errors and warnings.

### Example Log File

```

### Command for AI
Summarize errors and warnings from this log file.


## Explain Complex SQL

### Scenario
You have a complex SQL query with multiple joins and aggregations, and you need to understand its logic.

### Example SQL Query (Before "edit with AI")
```sql
SELECT
    c.customer_name,
    COUNT(o.order_id) AS total_orders,
    SUM(p.price) AS total_spent
FROM
    customers c
    JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
    JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
    JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE
    c.signup_date > '2022-01-01'
GROUP BY
    c.customer_name
HAVING
    total_spent > 500
ORDER BY
    total_spent DESC;
```

### Command for AI
Explain this SQL query in plain language, including the purpose of each join, filtering condition, and aggregation. Keep it short.

## Automatically Clean Datasets

### Scenario
You have a messy dataset with missing values and incorrect data types. You need code to clean it up.

### Example Input Requirements
```plaintext
1. `prompt`: Must be a string between 1 and 2000 characters, no HTML/scripts
2. `temperature`: Must be a float between 0.0 and 2.0
3. `max_tokens`: Must be an integer between 1 and 4000
4. `stop_sequences`: Optional, but if provided must be a list of strings
```

### Command for AI
Create Python code to Validate and sanitize this data before passing to an LLM, according to given requirements.
